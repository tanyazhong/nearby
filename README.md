## About
nEARby allows users to view what songs people are listening to, share their songs with others, 
and view/open profiles, relative to their location. If a user wants to share their music to those around them,
they can press the 'Share' option, login to their Spotify account, allow our app certain permissions, and their music
will automatically be populated into our database based on their location. If a user doesn't want to share their music,
they can select the 'Lurk' option and still be able to view the songs around them. However, the app does require all users to share their location
because all functionality of the app is dependent on music and people nearby. nEARby also connects users together. By tapping
on any of the songs shown, users can open up the profiles of those who played that song and also open their profile in Spotify to potentially
follow them.
