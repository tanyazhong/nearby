## About
nEARby allows users to view what songs people are listening to, share their songs with others, 
and view/open profiles, relative to their location. If a user wants to share their music to those around them,
they can press the 'Share' option, login to their Spotify account, allow our app certain permissions, and their music
will automatically be populated into our database based on their location. If a user doesn't want to share their location.
